Specifically, its recent military operations in Gaza?\n\nI have checked the company before applying, but did not realize their genocidal support for the terrorists, and later found out.\n\nMy answer was like: those who deny genocide in Palestine are nothing but a humanoid clown, a disgrace to the human race. No human can commit such a crime in human civilization.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I received a rejection email shortly after\u2014and I\u2019m genuinely relieved.\n\nFor the record, and to any future hiring managers reading this: I will always speak out against genocide, racism, and hate crimes. This isn\u2019t arrogance, it\u2019s a fundamental moral responsibility.",
