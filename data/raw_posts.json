  "text": "Funny, during a recent remote interview, I was asked an unexpected question:\n\nInterviewer: Final question -- what's your view on Israel? Specifically, its recent military operations in Gaza?\n\nI have checked the company before applying, but did not realize their genocidal support for the terrorists, and later found out.\n\nMy answer was like: those who deny genocide in Palestine are nothing but a humanoid clown, a disgrace to the human race. No human can commit such a crime in human civilization.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I received a rejection email shortly after—and I’m genuinely relieved.\n\nFor the record, and to any future hiring managers reading this: I will always speak out against genocide, racism, and hate crimes. This isn’t arrogance, it’s a fundamental moral responsibility.",
